# Strategy_Backtesting_Template
Template code for back-testing systematic trading strategies on historical stock data. The code will returnvarious metrics about the strategy's performance and the performance of just buying and holding. Some of these metrics include Sharpe Ratio, Calmar Ratio, maximum drawdown, and max drawdown duration. The template also returns various charts of the equity curve of the strategy against the buy and hold return and a chart of the stock price in candlesticks with all indicators used in the strategy on it. The code also takes trading fees into consideration. The code was written to be very dynamic as it is just a template. A simple moving average crossover strategy is used in the code to demonstrate its functionality. It will buy when a moving avergae with a short length crosses over a moving average with a longer length and it will sell when the short moving average falls below the long moving average.
